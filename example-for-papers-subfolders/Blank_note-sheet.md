## Title:
Bacterial Diversity Associated with Blood Falls, a Subglacial Outflow from the Taylor Glacier, Antarctica
## Keywords:
Subglacial, brine, diversity, 16S amplicons, glacier, Antarctic
## Geographic Coverage
Blood Falls, Taylor Glacier, Antarctica
## Field Dates:
Winters 2000-2006
## Significance:
This is a clone library study revealing the *in situ* diversity of Blood Falls.

## Notes:
Blood Falls is a subzero, hypersaline brine outflow from Taylor Glacier, Antarctica.

The brine sampled had been isolated from atmospheric contact and sunlight for approximately 2 million years and was likely of marine origin.

The brine was primarily inhabited by Gammaproteobacteria, particularly in heavier outflow periods.

Isolates from the brine include *Marinobacter* and *Psychrobacter*.

Brine community Shannon diversity was H' = 1.75.

Chao1 index indicated incomplete sampling for whole community taxonomy.
