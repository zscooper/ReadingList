## Title:
Ecological Studies of Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida) in Beaufort Sea Coastal Waters, Alaska
## Keywords:
arctic cod, life history, distribution, spawning
## Geographic Coverage
Beaufort Sea
## Field Dates:
05/30/1977 - 05/01/1980
## Significance:
One of the earlier papers investigating the life history of Arctic cod from samples collected off the north slope of Alaska both nearshore and on the shelf break.  Arctic cod were found to be present in the coastal Beaufort year round.

## Notes:
Arctic cod are a major trophic link between zooplankton and upper trophic levels, and more information on their life history and distribution is needed.

This study investigates the year round utilization of coastal Beaufort waters by Arctic cod.

Samples were collected in both ice-free and ice-covered conditions throughout the north slope of Alaska in brackish coastal lagoons and a station out on the shelfbreak.

Arctic cod in open ice season were caught mostly by fyke net, and gill nets were used for ice covered conditions, though a variety of methods were used over the 3-year span.

Fish were analyzed for:
- fork length
- weight
- sex
- maturity (reproductive condition, egg condition, weight, and size if applicable)
- age (otoliths)
- diet (stomach samples were taken from a subset of the fish collected)

Young of the year arctic cod were abundant in summer, in winter juvenile and adult arctic cod were dominant, especially at the offshore sites.

The fish moving in and out of the lagoons were highly mobile, with wide variability in daily catches.

The fish appeared to leave the coastal lagoons in mid to late winter, and offshore populations remained throughout the winter.

Arctic cod presence in the lagoons increased with cooling temperatures and increasing salinity in late summer.

Salinity was the only significant environmental variable explaining the variability in daily catches of arctic cod at the Milne Point sampling site.

Age at maturity was determined based on "known spawners" and the ratio of gonads to body weight in addition to egg conditions.  Males were mostly 2-3, females 3.

Spawning occurred sometime between November and February, with fish nearing spawning condition being caught in early winter.

Arctic cod exhibit an r-strategy, leaning towards high productivity (relative short life/success rate), allocating greater proportion of its resources to reproduction. **"...it would not be advantageous for Arctic cod to invest its reproductive potential in large, long-lived individuals if mature fish are as vulnerable as juveniles to the principal sources of mortality."**  If this is true, arctic cod are more likely to be successful in recovering from catastrophic perturbations (oil spills, single year swings) than other coastal arctic species.

Concluding hypotheses
* Arctic cod are highly tolerant of modulating temperature, salinity, and turbidity conditions
* Arctic cod are the most abundant and widely distributed fish in the Beaufort, but are outnumbered in river outflow regions
* Arctic cod are small, short-lived fish which mature early and may spawn only once
