## Title:
Fish communities across a spectrum of habitats in the western Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea
## Keywords:
arctic cod, benthic, trawl, chukchi, beaufort, lagoon
## Geographic Coverage:
Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, East Siberian Sea
## Field Dates:

## Significance:
Synthesized five years of surveys to look at differences in abundance (density) of animals from the lagoon to shelf slope in the Chukchi and Beaufort.  They also looked at icthyoplankton.  Based on Icthyoplankton, they state that the Beaufort Sea shelf is likely a spawning location for Arctic cod.

## Notes:
This was a big project looking at all of the data that had already been collected up until the first year of the first AIES project (such as BASIS, Oshoro Maru, RUSALCA and ABL surveys).  Because of the many different locations and net types, CPUE was used to compare across all locations.  Shelf break data in the Beaufort is from Sandi Parker-Stetter (Parker-Stetter et al., 2011), but not the acoustic biomass, just midwater CPUE.

"In the three habitats outside of the lagoon, Arctic Cod were largest in the shelf benthic, although smaller age-0 fish were present...eggs, larvae, and juveniles were found in the shelf icthyoplankton"

Saffron cod spawn on the shelf and move into the nearshore and lagoon with age.

Forage fish (capelin in particular) were mostly caught nearshore/beach or in shelf surface waters.  They appear to prefer warmer low-salinity waters, particularly when younger (they spawn in the beach and intertidal)

Concluding hypotheses
* "This suggests that Arctic Cod use the Beaufort Sea shelf for spawning and larval development, development of age-0 fish occurs throughout the nearshore and shelf and fish move/stay off- shore as they age."
* Arctic cod use the shelf  for larval development or spawning - "The pattern in fish lengths and ichthyoplankton catch suggests that Arctic Cod use nearshore and shelf habitats for multiple life history functions, with the older Cod staying/moving offshore to the shelf benthic habitat"
* Spawning hypothesis for A.cod is the same for both the Chukchi and Beaufort: spawning and larval development takes place on the Shelf, fish move offshore as they age
* Saffron cod may spawn offshore and move into lagoons as they age in the beaufort, but do the opposite (larval development nearshore, adults offshore) in the Chukchi.
