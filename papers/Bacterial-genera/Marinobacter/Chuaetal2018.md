## Title:
Genomic and physiological characterization and description of *Marinobacter gelidimuriae* sp. nov., a psychrophilic, moderate halophile from Blood Falls, an antarctic subglacial brine
## Keywords:
Marinobacter, isolation, physiology, genomics, metabolism, halophile, psychrophile
## Geographic Coverage
Antarctica, Blood Falls
## Field Dates:

## Significance:
Isolation of *Marinobacter gelidimuriae* sp. nov. from Antarctic subglacial brine

## Notes:
*Marinobacter gelidimuriae* is named after type strain BF04_CF4, isolated from Blood Falls, Taylor Glacier, Antarctica.

Closest relatives include *Marinobacter psychrophilus*, isolated from Canadian Basin sea ice.

*Marinobacter gelidimuriae* is capable of growth on single carbon sources including acetate, L-alanine, D-alanine, and L-leucine.

It is capable of nitrate reduction under anaerobic conditions, possibly coupled to Fe(III) oxidation.

The genome contains key signs of salt and cold adaptation including compatible solute metabolism, cold shock proteins, chaperones, and RNA helicases.

Growth occurs from 0-20C (opt 15C) and 0.8-15% NaCl (opt 6%).

Concluding hypotheses
* *Marinobacter* has characteristics lending to it being cosmopolitan in cold brines
* *Marinobacter gelidimuriae* is a psychrophilic, moderate halophile.
* *Marinobacter gelidimuriae* can grow aerobically on single carbon sources
* *Marinobacter gelidimuriae* can grow anaerobically via nitrate reduction
