## Title:
The Genome Sequence of *Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4, a Psychroactive Siberian Permafrost Bacterium, Reveals Mechanisms for Adaptation to Low-Temperature Growth
## Keywords:
Psychrobacter, genomics, metabolism, cold-adaptation
## Geographic Coverage
Siberia, Permafrost
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
First genome sequence of a cold-adapted, terrestrial bacterium *Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4

## Notes:
*Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4 displays genomic traits characteristic of cold-adaptation including increased protein flexibiltity, simple metabolism off of acetate (ubiquitous and abundant C source), and fatty acid unsaturation.

*Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4 can grow in a range of –10 to 28˚C.

*Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4 cannot sustain metabolism solely using carbohydrates.

No signs of obvious HGT are seen in *Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4, but viral transduction appears to have played a role in shaping its genome

Concluding hypotheses
* *Psychrobacter arcticus* 273-4 is genomically adapted to the cold
* It can grow well on acetate in a defined minimal medium
* Viruses, but not lateral transfer, likely played a significant role in structuring the genome
