## Keywords:

## Field Dates:

## Significance:
This book chapter discusses the understanding of the dominant phenotypes associated with the genus *Psychrobacter* as of 2006.

## Notes:
*Psychrobacter* spp. are generally psychrotolerant and halotolerant with growth observed from -15˚C to 37˚C.

All spp. grow well between 7 and 20˚.

They are generally considered strict aerobes, but I'm skeptical

They are known to non-specifically consume organic carbon

Most are non-motile but may have fimbriae that allow twitching motility.

Can be pathogenic in humans and animals and are known to spoil food.
