## Title:
Extreme environments as model systems for the study of microbial evolution
## Keywords:
Extreme environments, evolution, diversity, HGT
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:

## Significance:
This is a book chapter Life in Extreme Environments (ed. Dirk Wagner) discussing the study of microbial evolution in extreme environments.

## Notes:
Community diversity is generally known to decrease with increasing abiotic extremity of an environment.

HGT is likely to be more important in extreme environments where rapid evolution is beneficial.

HGT is fairly well characterized in thermophiles, halophiles, and acido-/alkaliphiles, but not in psychrophiles, piezophiles, or subsurface organisms.

Exaptation (function different than original) is likely quite important for polyextremophiles.

Mechanisms of HGT and evolution likely vary by environment and taxa.
