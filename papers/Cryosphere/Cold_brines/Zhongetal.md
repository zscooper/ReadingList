## Title:
Viral ecogenomics of Arctic cryopeg brine and sea ice
## Keywords:
viral communities, extreme environments, virus-host interactions, cold adaptation, salt adaptation, horizontal gene transfer
## Geographic Coverage
Utqiagvik, Alaska
## Field Dates:
May 2018; May 2017
## Significance:
This (pre-submission) paper uses a modern ecogenomics toolkit to investigate baseline interactions of viruses and bacteria in subzero brines from the Arctic. I co-authored this paper, collected the samples, and processed the microbial profile data.

## Notes:
Viruses from SZBs infect dominant microbial taxa.

Many viruses in cryopegs and sea ice brines are unknown.

Several viral populations encode FAD genes that appear to be AMGs that assist with membrane function in the cold.

Cryopeg vFAD genes form a distinct clade with no close matches in the cryopeg metagenomes.
