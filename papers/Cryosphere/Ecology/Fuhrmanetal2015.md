## Significance:
This review discusses the dynamics of marine microbial communities and the scales and effects that control them.

## Notes:
Microbial communities generally follow dynamics that are reflective of the changes in environmental chemistry and physics.

In surface oceans, microbial communities often vary at in an annual frequency where communities that are twelve months apart are more similar than those that are six months apart (seasonal dynamics).

Short-term dynamics involve rapid changes in nutrients due to oceanographic events (upwelling, eddy advection) or to biological blooms (phytoplankton).

Observation of community dynamics (over time) can reveal ecological niches occupied by different taxa that may not immediately be obvious from genomes alone.

Ecological and genomic species definitions don't perfectly match, so caution needs to be taken when interpreting the role of a species in its environment.
