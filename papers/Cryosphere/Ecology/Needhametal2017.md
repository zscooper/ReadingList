## Title:
Ecological dynamics and co-occurrence among marine phytoplankton, bacteria and myoviruses shows microdiversity matters
## Keywords:
community, bacteria, viruses, phytoplankton, dynamics
## Geographic Coverage
San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT)
## Field Dates:
March-September 2011
## Significance:
This study uses 16S, ITS, and g23 (major capsid protein) amplicon assays to assess changes in microbial community dynamics over time at a high taxonomic (microdiversity) resolution.

## Notes:
This study primarily investigated the interactions of phytoplankton-bacteria-viruses using OTU (99%) and ASV (unique) levels to see which resolution was important in understanding ecological dynamics.

SAR11 had extremely high microdiversity (>300 ASVs for 26 OTUs), implying ASVs are more telling of their ecology than OTUs.

ASVs better revealed correlations of myoviral infections than OTUs.

The analysis revealed that particle-attached bacteria (copiotrophs) likely contribute higher number of viruses to the pelagic community than free living bacteria do.

Some ASVs here appear to be millions of years old, showing that OTUs don't provide as in depth of a look at evolution as possible.

High resolution data are more telling of ecological function for common than ephemeral taxa.
