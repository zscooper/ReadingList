## Title:
Phylogenetic Analysis of Bacteria Preserved in a Permafrost Ice Wedge for 25,000 Years
## Keywords:
Permafrost, ice wedge, phylogenetics, microbial communities
## Geographic Coverage
Fox Permafrost Tunnel, Alaska
## Field Dates:
2007
## Significance:
Phylogenetic analysis of microbes preserved in an ice wedge for 25,000 years

## Notes:
This study identified isolates of bacteria from an ice wedge in the Fox permafrost tunnel that was 25,000 years old.

Isolates from the ice wedge were mainly Gammaproteobacteria and many grew at –5˚C.

This study captures phylogenetic diversity of *viable* bacteria from an ice wedge

Concluding hypotheses
* Viable bacteria can be found in ice wedges ~25,000 years old.
* Diversity of isolates from the ice wedge was low.
* Bacteria may be employing survival strategies involving *in situ* activity in the ice wedge.
