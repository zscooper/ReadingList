## Title:
Ion concentrations in ice wedges: An innovative approach to reconstruct past climate variability
## Keywords:
Beaufort Sea, last deglaciation, ion concentrations, Barrow, ice wedge
## Geographic Coverage
Utqiagvik, Alaska
## Field Dates:
Summer 2016
## Significance:
This study investigates ionic composition of the Barrow Ice Wedge System (massive ice in my paper) as a proxy for paleoclimate and geography records

## Notes:
BIWS was probably influenced by seawater moisture at time of formation (late pleistocene)

BIWS was deposited ~12,500 ybp

MS- ion concentrations suggest high marine productivity during ice deposition
