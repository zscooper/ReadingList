## Title:
Characterization of viable bacteria from siberian permafrost by 16S rDNA sequencing
## Keywords:
Permafrost, viability, bacteria, isolation
## Geographic Coverage
Siberia, permafrost
## Field Dates:
08/01/1989, 08/01/1990
## Significance:
This study isolated and identified viable bacteria from permafrost using 16S sequencing.

## Notes:
It was understood in the early 1990s that bacteria could be found in permafrost that were not just preserved but also viable. This is one of the first studies to use sequencing, and not just morphological or functional techniques, to identify permafrost bacteria that are alive *in situ*. The taxonomic findings indicate that selection (to the permafrost conditions) is a stronger force on community structure than evolution.

Concluding hypotheses
* Selection plays a stronger role than evolution in structuring microbial communities in permafrost because of the low availability of water, nutrients, and oxygen relative to other cryotic environments, such as sea ice.
* Metabolic activity in permafrost must be very slow and limited to microenvironments where water is available.
