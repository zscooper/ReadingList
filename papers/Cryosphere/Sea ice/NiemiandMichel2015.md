## Title:
Temporal and spatial variability in sea-ice carbon:nitrogen ratios on Canadian Arctic shelves
## Keywords:
carbon, nitrogen, stoichiometry, sea ice, Arctic
## Geographic Coverage
Arctic Ocean
## Field Dates:
2001-2013
## Significance:
This study conducts a temporal and spatial survey of C:N ratios in sea ice.

## Notes:
C:N ratios in Arctic sea ice vary with time and space.

Biogeochemical models need to use variable C:N ratios to properly predict carbon flux in Arctic sea ice.

C:N is generally higher in Winter than in Spring.
