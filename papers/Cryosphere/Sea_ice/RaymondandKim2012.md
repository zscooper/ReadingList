## Title:
Possible Role of Horizontal Gene Transfer in the Colonization of Sea Ice by Algae
## Keywords:
sea ice, bacteria, diatoms, ice-binding, horizontal gene transfer, colonization
## Geographic Coverage
Polar sea ice
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This study surveys ice binding proteins (IBPs) from sea ice diatoms to assess the origins of these proteins.

## Notes:
IBPs are found here in several strains of sea ice diatoms (and other algae) that all have significant effects on the structure of sea ice including brine pore size reduction and crystallization inhibition.

There is a notable incongruence in the tree topologies of the IBP genes and the 18S tree of the algae containing the IBPs that points to HGT as the most parsimonious explanation.

Bacteria from sea ice (in the layer with diatoms) express IBPs.

Euk-IBPs are most closely related to IBPs found in psychrophilic bacteria known from sea ice (after significant relation to each other).

Viruses are implicated as agents of inter-domain HGT

An Antarctic copepod appears to contain IBP genes expressed in all cell types. (not elaborated on here)
