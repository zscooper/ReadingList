## Title:
An ice-binding protein from an Antarctic sea ice bacterium
## Keywords:
sea ice, bacteria, protein, ice-binding, horizontal gene transfer
## Geographic Coverage
WAP, Antarctica
## Field Dates:
2002
## Significance:
This paper isolates, purifies, and sequences an ice-binding protein (IBP) from bacteria for the first time.

## Notes:
The IBP in this study is from a species of *Colwellia*.

This IBP is not found in Cp34H, but is sporadically found in other sea ice bacteria.

This IBP has AA sequence similarity to IBPs previously characterized from sea ice diatoms and snow molds.

AA sequence similarity to Eurkaryotic IBPs is a possible indication of inter-domain HGT.
