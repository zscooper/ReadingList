## Title:
A METHOD FOR MEASURING BACTERIAL PIGMENTS BY THE USE OF THE SPECTROPHOTOMETER AND THE PHOTOELECTRIC COLORIMETER
## Keywords:
Bacteria, pigment, spectrophotometry, methods
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This paper defines an early and simple method for measuring bacterial pigments.

## Notes:
Pigments can be measured from bacterial suspensions using spectrophotometry.

Spectra give information about turbidity and pigmentation that can be normalized to give differential pigment production values.
