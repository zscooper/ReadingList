## Title:
Biogeochemical implications of the ubiquitous colonization of marine habitats and redox gradients by *Marinobacter* species
## Keywords:
Marinobacter, bacteria, metabolism, ecology
## Geographic Coverage
Global, marine
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Major review of *Marinobacter* spp.

## Notes:
*Marinobacter* is a consistent colonizer of marine and hypersaline environments with diverse physiological traits.

*Marinobacter hydrocarbanoclasticus* is the first isolated species of the genus. The genus is known to have many members involved in hydrocarbon degradation, metabolism of sole carbon sources, and metal oxidation. All known species have a sodium requirement.

*Marinobacter* is known to occupy a variety of thermal niches, mostly mesophilic, some thermophilic, some psychrotolerant, and some psychrophilic.

*Marinobacter* spp. are thought to be r-strategists deploying opportunistic metabolic strategies.

Concluding hypotheses
* *Marinobacter* are ubiquitous colonizers of saline environments with complex organic substrates.
* Most species are sourced from marine environments, but some are terrestrial (still possibly marine sourced)
* *Marinobacter* are r-strategists (opportunistic)
