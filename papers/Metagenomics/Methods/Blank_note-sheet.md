Microbial GWAS coming of age
## Keywords:
Bacteria, genomics, genome wide association study, phenotype, genotype
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This is a Nature News and Reviews article on GWAS for bacteria, an uncommon practice.

## Notes:
GWAS - genome wide association study

GWAS can link genotype to phenotype using statistics and modeling

GWAS are often performed in human genetics, but are uncommon for bacteria.

Concluding hypotheses
* With more genetic info becoming available for bacteria, GWAS are becoming more practical
* This article references a study linking antimicrobial resistance to genotypes
* GWAS maybe easier conducted on strains that are known to be more recombinant than clonal
