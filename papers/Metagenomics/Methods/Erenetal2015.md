## Title:
Anvi’o: an advanced analysis and visualization platform for ‘omics data
## Keywords:
Metagenomics, Assembly, Genome binning, Visualization, SNP profiling, Metatranscriptomics, genomics
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This paper describes and tests the function of a community supported software package for analyzing genomic data from metagenomes.

## Notes:
Anvi'o is a publicly available suite of programs that assist with processing genomic information from binned genomes: http://merenlab.org/projects/anvio

Anvi'o can operate from raw metagenome data, binning and analyzing all reads using purpose-built databases.

Anvi'o can also operate on imported, processed bins

It can profile nucleotide variation as it creates bins or from mapped bins

The interface is designed to be interactive and to output easy to understand and share visualizations as svgs/html pages
