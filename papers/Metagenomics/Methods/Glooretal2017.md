## Title:
Microbiome Datasets Are Compositional: And This Is Not Optional
## Keywords:
Metagenomics, sequencing, data analysis, microbiome, compositional
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This paper reviews the issues and approaches to dealing with compositional data.

## Notes:
Reporting relative abundances of reads can be misleading since different total read counts may skew relative abundances in stochastic ways.

Centered log-ratio transformation of data can account for differential read abundances and feed into more meaningful analyses that are less likely to give false-positive results.

Concluding hypotheses
* Microbiome data shouldn't be rarefied or normalized, but it should be transformed to account for compositional differneces.
* Transformed data is less likely to give false-positive results.
