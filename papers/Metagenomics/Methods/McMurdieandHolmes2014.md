## Title:
Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is Inadmissible
## Keywords:
microbiome, rarefying, transformation, amplicons, 16S
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This paper refutes the common practice of rarefying compositional amplicon data and suggests a more appropriate method for comparing amplicon data across samples.

## Notes:
Rarefying increases false positive representation of OTUs between differentially abundant samples.

Rarefying data propagates variance of accuracy, and can create problems.

Simple relative abundance normalization is more accurate than rarefying.

Log transformation is not perfect but still reduces variance over rarefying.
