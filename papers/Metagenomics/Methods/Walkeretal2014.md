## Title:
Pilon: An Integrated Tool for Comprehensive Microbial Variant Detection and Genome Assembly Improvement
## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:

## Significance:
This paper describes the Pilon assembly improvement tool that's applied by the Sullivan Lab in polishing long read assemblies with short reads.

## Notes:
Pilon is designed to improve genome assemblies by iteratively improving sequences with overlapping data.

Pilon does a good job of resolving SNPs and other small base modifications between different genomic pieces, whether other genomes or other chromosomes.

Pilon resolves repeat regions well by reassembling these sections after initial assmebly.

Pilon also captures large sequence polymorphisms better than other assemblers.

Pilon is mostly automated.
