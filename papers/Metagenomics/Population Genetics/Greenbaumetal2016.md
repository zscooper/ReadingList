## Significance:
This paper describes a method for analyzing population structure using network analyses based on distance-based clustering.

## Notes:
This paper looks at human population structures using network analyses.

They use allele frequency to estimate genetic distance between populations.

The network algorithm discussed has different thresholds that they tested to find an appropriate sensitivity required for identifying meaningful splits in populations.

They use a strength of association distribution (SAD) analysis to look at gene flow within populations.
