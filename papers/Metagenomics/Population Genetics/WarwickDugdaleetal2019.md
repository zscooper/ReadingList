## Significance:
First use of combined long and short read metaviromics to produce data useful for understanding microdiversity within a viral population

## Notes:
Combination of hybrid and short read sequences allows for greater and higher accuracy recovery of viral genomes from metagenomic data.

The newly developed VirION package optimizes long read sequencing for the recovery of viral genomes.

Approx. 97% coverage of genomes present in a mock community were recovered by "polished" hybrid assemblies.

Concluding hypotheses
* Whole viral genomes may be recovered on single reads as nanopore sequencing improves
* Combining long and short read sequencing optimizes coverage while minimizing error
