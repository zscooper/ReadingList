## Title:
Genomic variation in microbial populations inhabiting the marine subseafloor at deep-sea hydrothermal vents
## Keywords:
Population genetics
## Geographic Coverage
Von Damm/Piccard HTVs, Mid-Cayman Rise, Caribbean Sea
## Field Dates:
2012 and 2013
## Significance:
This study explores evolution in hydrothermal vent microbial populations using population genetics to investigate genomic variation in MAGs.

## Notes:
Hydrothermal vents provide dynamic environments with a range of conditions, often lending to higher diversity and incidences of HGT than observed in more stable environments.

Ratio of single amino acid variation to single nucleotide variation (SAAV/SNV) can be a useful indicator of how diversification actuates change in a population.

MAGs with few SNVs often represented abundant strains of bacteria in their environment.

High diversity is observed within the genus *Sulfurovum* in these environments, but two MAGs of this genus were observed with high coverage and low SNV density indicating that they were subjected to distinct ecological pressure relative to other *Sulfurovum* populations.
