## Title:
Prokaryote genome fluidity is dependent on effective population size
## Keywords:
population genetics; diversity; prokaryotes; evolution; pangenomes
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This paper uses pangenomes to suggest that population evolution is dominated by neutral evolution.

## Notes:
Effective population size, N_e, positively correlates with synonymous nucleotide diversity.

Genomic fluidity, φ, is defined as the ratio of unique gene families to the sum of gene families in pairs of genomes averaged over randomly chosen genome pairs from within a group of sampled genomes.

Genomic fluidity positively correlates with synonymous nucleotide diversity.

φ ignores genome rearrangement and plasmids and doesn't consider HGT in calculations of genome fluidity.
