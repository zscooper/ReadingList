## Title:
Genome-wide selective sweeps and gene-specific sweeps in natural bacterial populations
## Keywords:
genomics, population genomics, metagenomics, diversification
## Geographic Coverage
Trout Bog Lake, WI, USA
## Field Dates:
2005-2013 (discotinuous)
## Significance:
This study uses SNP frequencies in MAGs to study population changes over time in a freshwater lake.

## Notes:
Intra-population SNP variability indicates diversification between members of a population.

Non-synonymous SNP mutations (changing AA sequennce) were rare.

One population of *Chlorobium*-111 was observed to undergo a genome wide selective sweep over the sampling period, a process never before observed.

Genome regions (islands) were also observed to sweep through several populations indicating recombination events.
