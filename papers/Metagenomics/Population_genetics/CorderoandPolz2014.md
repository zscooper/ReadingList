## Significance:
This review discusses how the frequency of a gene present in a population can result from ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

## Notes:
Microbial populations can roughly be defined as a geno/phenotypically close microbes that have obvious signs of gene flow.

Often, ecological (environmental) barriers are more defining of a population than phylogeny.

Studies of flexible (pan) genomes should consider genes at the frequency of occurrence in a population, not as a positive or negative occurrence.

Low frequency genes are often results of high gene exchange activity often from outside the population boundary.

Low frequency genes can also be result of selective pressures specific to the environment.

High frequency genes are generally required for normal function (housekeeping).

Medium frequency genes can be the result of complex ecological strategies, such as production and cheating to use the same pool of molecules.

Low and medium frequency genes can be the result of frequency-dependent selection from an environment.
