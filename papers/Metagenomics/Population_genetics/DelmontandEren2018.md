## Title:
Linking pangenomes and metagenomes: the *Prochlorococcus* metapangenome
## Keywords:
Pangenomes, metagenomics, *Prochlorococcus*, population genomics, bioinformatics, ecology, microbiology, genomics
## Geographic Coverage
Atlantic Ocean surface, Tara
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This study creates a pipeline using Anvi'o to profile population genomic variances using metagenomes

## Notes:
Comparing binned genomes from metagenomes with isolate genomes can reveal subtle environmental influences on gene content that affect adaptability to an environment.

Sugar metabolism in *Prochlorococcus* occurs largely in hypervariable genomic islands that likely reflect adaptation to local conditions.

Anvi'o contains complex tools for analyzing and visualizing differences between gene content in metapangenomic data.

Isolate genomes often only reflect a small subset of genes seen in an environment, possibly due to selective biases upon culturing.
