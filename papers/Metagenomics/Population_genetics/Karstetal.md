## Title:
Enabling high-accuracy long-read amplicon sequences using unique molecular identifiers and Nanopore sequencing (pre-print)
## Keywords:
Nanopore, amplicon, rRNA
## Geographic Coverage
N/A
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
Pre-print of a methods development for producing high accuracy consensus sequences from amplicons generated using Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing.

## Notes:
This is a pre-print from BioRxiv.

A library preparation and sequence processing method is developed for generating single molecule consensus sequences using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).

Error rates associated with Nanopore or PacBio are driven down to 0.03% with this method.

Concluding hypotheses
* More informative data can be generated from reliably sequencing long read amplicons
