## Title:
Disentangling the impact of environmental and phylogenetic constraints on prokaryotic within-species diversity
## Keywords:
pangenome, diversity, population genetics, prokaryotes
## Geographic Coverage
Global
## Field Dates:
N/A
## Significance:
This study captures patterns of pangenome variation and assesses the effects of phylogenetic inertia and environmental influence.

## Notes:
Large genome size is correlated with environmental ubiquity; other pangenome features are not associated with ubiquity.

Large core-genome may be important for persistence and proliferation in multiple habitats; secondary metabolite biosynthesis may be an important contributing factor.

Habitat and phylogeny contribute to 49% and 18% of variability in pangenome patterns, respectively.

Microdiversity is likely not reflective of environmental or phylogenetic patterns, but a result of local within-species evolution.

"Species with a higher nucleotide diversity within their core-genome were positively associated with aquatic habitats"
