## Significance:
This paper discusses and reviews the evolutionary and ecological reasons for pangenomes in prokaryotes.

## Notes:
HGT is common and usually implicated in opening pangenomes (expanding the accessory genome).

HGT tends to be adaptive, not just neutral or deleterious.

The entire bacterial pangenome is theoretically infinite.

Gene loss can be adaptive as well as gene gain.

Effective population size and the ability to migrate are the most important factors in structuring pangenomes.
