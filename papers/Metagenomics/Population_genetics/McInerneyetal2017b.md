## Significance:
This paper responds to Shapiro's criticism of McInerney and Andreani et al.'s efforts to explain pangenome evolution as neutral or adaptive.

## Notes:
"At least five factors correlate — organismal lifestyle (intracellular parasites at one extreme, global free-living organisms at the other) correlates with pangenome size (minimal accessory genome at one extreme and minimal core genome at the other), which correlates with rate of horizontal gene transfer (low to high), which correlates with size of effective population size (Ne)(from small to large), which correlates with efficiency of natural selection."

96.5-97% of genes in a prokaryotic genome are generally fully intact and functional and most single nucleotide mutations are synonymous.

E. coli pangenomes can have >50% accessory genes, but the function of many accessory genes is unknown.

Traditional models miss some basic effects of populations. Genomic sweeps should occur where selection is efficient, which would lower pangenome diversity. However, paradoxically, large N_e and efficient selection both correlate with large pangenome sizes.

There's still much more to learn!
