## Significance:
This paper addresses McInerney et al. and Andreani et al. (2017) to discuss their opposing views on pangenome evolution.

## Notes:
McInerney et al. treat HGT as a normal mutation that behaves at a constant mutation rate, µ. However, the introduction of genes via HGT is not the same as µ since the donor gene pool may be much larger than effective population size, N_e.

Both papers make valid points but make difficult assumptions.

It may not be possible to reconcile pangenome evolution on a species-by-species basis but may be more effectively considered on a gene-by-gene basis.
