## Title:
Are pangenomes adaptive or not?
## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage

## Field Dates:

## Significance:
This is a response to Shapiro's criticism of Andreani et al and McInerney et al. primarily arguing against McInerey et al.'s suggestion that most pangenomic diversity is adaptive.

## Notes:
They don't find the points about most pangenomic diversity being adaptive by McInerney et al. to be compelling for a list of reasons (not really fruitful, just argumentative).

They argue that most gene content changes are not likely adaptive but:
They concede that it is likely that most gene transfer events in a population are likely advantageous even if the majority of genes taken up are deleterious or neutral (and therefore wouldn't show up abundantly in the population and would be driven out rapidly).
