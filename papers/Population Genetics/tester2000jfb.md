## Significance:
This is an early review of culture-independent studies of bacterial diversity/populations in the environment.

## Notes:
Metagenomic sequencing has pioneered the way for understanding microbial communities that evade culture-based techniques. Early studies used BAC clone libraries to produce environmental sequences. These studies provided valuable information, but do have some drawbacks related to maximum possible genome fragment size, copy numbers, and artificial chimeras. Nevertheless, environmental metagenomics allows for population-level genomic variation studies that culture-based studies could not achieve.

Concluding hypotheses
* This paper reviews the state of environmental microbial genomics in the early 2000s
* Population genomics studies can allow for the discernment of the role of lateral transfer, recombination, and genetic drift in the diversification of a population
* BAC cloning techniques provide valuable information, but have some technical drawbacks
