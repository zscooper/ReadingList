## Title:
Lost in a sea of fishes: behavioral ecology of the pacific basin
## Keywords:
Mine, mine, mine
## Geographic Coverage
Amnemonemomne, East Australian Current
## Field Dates:
05/30/2005 - 05/31/2005
## Significance:
This is the first documented case of blue-tang (*Paracanthurus hepatus*) and blue whale (*Balaenoptera musculus*) auditory communication.

## Notes:
There's mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see.

There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me.

Concluding hypotheses
* Fish are friends, not food
* Don't swim towards the butt
* Dentists are bad at keeping pets
