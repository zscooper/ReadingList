## Title:
Observed increases in Bering Strait oceanic fluxes from the Pacific to the Arctic from 2001 to 2011 and their impacts on the Arctic Ocean water column
## Keywords:
bering strait, adcp, transport, heat
## Geographic Coverage
Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea
## Field Dates:
01/01/2001 - 12/01/2011
## Significance:
Trends of transport at Bering Strait from 2001 to 2011

## Notes:
Pacific waters:
- 1/3 of the freshwater input to the arctic
- 10-20% of heat input to the Arctic
- Source of under-ice heat

Bering Strait:
- Flow of homogenous across the strait
- Flow is surface intensified with a seasonal coastal current
- In the summer, it is a 2-layer system
- Velocity coherence makes it possible to estimate transport from moorings on either side of the strait
- VOlume is calculated from hourly northward velocity and the cross section at the strait
- Heat transport is calculated from transport and temperature
  - Lower level temperature data is from moorings
  - Upper level temperature comes from satellite SST measurements and project to 10 or 20 meters depth
- Freshwater transport is calculated from salinity measurements relative to Arctic mean salinity of 34.8
  - Assumed constant contribution from ice and ACC input

Since 2002, annual mean transport has been greater than .8 Sv (except for 2005), and has increased from .7 Sv in 2001 to 1.1 Sv in 2011.

Heat and freshwater fluxes depend on the changes in total transport
- 2007 was the highest heat transport on record.
- Freshwater flux, which only represents changes in the lower level salinity, likely underestimate the variability due to the impact of the ACC and stratification

Throughflow in the strait is due to a combination of the Pacific-Arctic pressure head and local winds
- The pressure head can be calculated from the transport and local winds (from NCEP measurements) as a function of transport = PH * C*wind velocity.
- Both forcings appear to increase from 2001 to 2011, with the pressure head increasing and southward winds weakening
- The increase in the pressure head is greater than the weakening of the winds, and there's an approx. 30% increase in the pressure head.
- Wind only explains 1/3 of the transport increase

Years of high heat input are driven by warmer lower level temperatures.  Increased mixing brings warmer water out of surface, and annual mean heat flux is strongly influence by late summer heating.  SST shows no significant trend.

There are two modes for water entering the strait, approximately equal in volume:
- pacific winter water: near freezing temperatures and salinity of 33.5
- pacific summer water: 1-4 C, salinity of 32-33
- The proportion of the two is consistent with the season
- Waters greater than 0C can be fresher than 33.1 but higher salinities are only found in colder waters
- This suggests a constant maximum salinity source for the pacific summer water that is likley related to the shelf break depth in the Bering Sea where the water originates.
  - Constancy of the Arctic property (the western Arctic water column contracts towards freezing at a salinity of 33.1 which is constant through time) is likely set by the conditions in the Bering

Conclusions:
- 50% increase in throughflow between 2001 and 2011
- 2/3 due to pressure head
- heat and freshwater variability is largely dependent on transport
- the estimate of freshwater transport is likely to be underestimated by not including ACC transport
- Lower level temperature suggests warming earlier, possibly due to increased transport of warm water from the south in spring
- Equal volumes of cold and warm waters to the Arctic
- Despite temperature variability, salinity of pacific summer water never exceeds 33.1, and the stability may explain the western arctic halocline
