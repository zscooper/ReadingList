## Keywords:

## Geographic Coverage
Barents Sea, Kara Sea, White Sea
## Field Dates:
12/01/1956 - 09/30/1970
## Significance:
Observations of eggs, larvae, and juveniles from 14 years of sampling Polar cod.  The early life cycle is described, and differences in specimen and development are attributed environmental conditions.

## Notes:
Majority of spawning polar cod stay near the ice margin and under sea ice for spawning, which occurs close to the surface in warmer temperatures.

Over a 14 years period, of 41,000 samples of polar cod (larvae and juvenile) were identified and measured.  Eggs were caught specifically in February of 1962 and 1963.  All sampling was done with icthyoplankton nets from either bottom or 50m depth to surface.

Egg Development
- Fertilized eggs average 1.77mm in diameter, and are buoyant due to the chorion (outer membrane) hardening and creating space and an increase in seawater absorption in the yolk.  Eggs are primarily colorless until the formation of the embryo.
- Embryonic period is connected to winter; duration of incubation and hatching time are related to the water temperature (50 days at -.5C, 77-79 days at -1.5C)
- Prelarvae are between 3.5 and 6mm, with hatching in the Barents sea beginning in March/April, and mass hatching in May-June.  This is expedited in southern regions and coastal areas.

Larval Development
- Elongated body, short and large head, and pigment bands along the margins of the caudal peduncle.
- Variability in pigmentation, including melanophore presence and coloration on the head.
- Larvae can be identified by the stronger development of the first two dorsal bands.
- The swim bladder fills with air at about 6mm in length of prelarvae
- They become completely dependent on food as the yolk sack dissappears at ~7-7.5mm
- Observations of other gadids, obtained from the same parent but incubated at different temperatures, can result in different larval lengths
- Differences in lengths of the caudal section (or % body length) can be evidence of different incubation temperatures
  - nearshore: short tailed
  - offshore: long tailed
- At 30mm length, adult features (teeth, barbel, fin formation) are present, defining them as juveniles

Until the end of July, larvae stay fairly shallow in the water column.  As they increase in size (>35mm), they descend deeper but stay in the water column.  From september to the follow spring, these fish are then caught in the bottom layer.

They perform seasonal feeding and wintering migrations that only differ from adults by the distance.

Concluding hypotheses
* Temperature increases in summer can speed growth of some populations relative to others
* Different environmental conditions during develop determine the pattern of pigmentation and caudal length
* Length of specimen at the end of their first year is dependent on the time of prelarvae hatching, which is directly related to temperature and food availability
